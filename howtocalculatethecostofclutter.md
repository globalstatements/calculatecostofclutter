## Introduction

Everyone knows there is an initial cost of purchasing a possession,
but what is often overlooked is the ongoing cost of keeping a
possession a person has already purchased. This is the cost related
the space the object takes up, and it is proportional to the size of
the object and the cost of occupying the building where the object
is kept --- in essence, the real estate cost. When you compare the
cost of a building to the cost of an ordinary possession, it is not
surprising that the cost of the space an object takes up can often
quickly exceed the same object’s original purchase price.

The purpose of the Calculate the Cost of Clutter app is to
provide a quick way to estimate the ongoing cost of owning a
specific possession. This app uses current U.S. real estate values,
currency, and units of measurement.

## Computational Model

The Calculate the Cost of Clutter app uses a simple estimating
model based on floor space, rent costs, and a factor to cover
maintenance costs, 
which may include climate control, cleaning, and insurance.

## Real Estate Value

Some real estate is more expensive than others, so the app
asks you to indicate the relative value of the real estate where
the item is kept. Most users should select the middle value.
The “High Rent District” may provide a more accurate estimate
for areas where commercial buildings are more than seven stories
tall and for beach front areas. Use the “Rural or Low Rent
District” setting for rural areas, less expensive neighborhoods,
and items stored in self storage facilities.

## Item Size

Use the width and depth sliders to indicate the size of the item
in inches. Use the radio buttons to indicate the best description
of the item’s location: on a shelf, in a box or drawer, or on the
floor.

## Cost

The values you enter are summarized on the right side of the page
along with the estimated cost per year of keeping the item.
